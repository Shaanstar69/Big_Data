Project Overview:

In this project, you will work with a dataset of transactions from a business or e-commerce platform. Your task is to process the data, clean it, and then analyze it using SQL queries to derive meaningful insights about the transactions. You will be using Python with the pandas library for data manipulation and SQLite for storing and querying the data.

The project will involve the following key steps:

Data Cleaning: You'll load the data from a CSV file, handle missing values, and convert any necessary columns (such as dates) to the correct format.
Database Creation and Insertion: You'll create a SQLite database and insert the cleaned data into it for easy querying.
Advanced SQL Queries: Using SQL, you'll write queries to analyze various aspects of the data, such as the top-selling products, monthly revenue trends, and customer spending patterns.
Advanced Analytics: You'll also write more complex SQL queries to explore specific business questions, such as which products are associated with certain keywords (e.g., Hadoop vs. Spark) or which cities have the highest transaction volume.
Key Tasks:

Data Loading and Cleaning:
Load the transaction data from a CSV file.
Handle missing values by removing incomplete rows or applying other strategies for data imputation.
Ensure that all date fields are correctly formatted and converted into the appropriate datetime type.
Database and Table Creation:
Set up a connection to an SQLite database.
Create a table called transactions to store the transaction data, ensuring the schema matches the required structure.
Data Insertion:
Insert the cleaned data from the pandas DataFrame into the SQLite database.
SQL Query Writing:
Write SQL queries to answer business questions:
Find the top 5 best-selling products.
Analyze the monthly revenue trend.
Evaluate the popularity of different payment methods.
Identify the top cities with the most transactions.
Rank the top spending customers.
Compare the sales of products related to Hadoop vs. Spark.
Identify the top spending customers in each city using advanced SQL techniques like subqueries and ranking.
Testing and Validation:
Ensure that the database and table are created successfully.
Validate the results of your SQL queries by checking for correctness and ensuring that the output makes sense based on the data.
Final Reporting:
Provide the final analysis results in the form of printed reports or data visualizations.
